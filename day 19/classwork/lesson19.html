<h1> Porsche GT2 RS </h1>
<p1>The Porsche 911 GT2 is a high-performance, 
track-focused sports car built by the German automobile manufacturer Porsche from 1993 to 2009, 
and then since 2010 as the GT2 RS.</p1>
<p2>It is based on the 911 Turbo, and uses a similar twin-turbocharged engine, 
but features numerous upgrades, including engine enhancements, 
larger brakes, and stiffer suspension calibration.</p2>

<p3>The GT2 is significantly lighter than the Turbo due to its use of rear-wheel-drive
instead of an all-wheel-drive system and the reduction or removal of interior components. 
As a result, the GT2 (now GT2 RS) is the most expensive and fastest model among the 911 lineup.</p3>
